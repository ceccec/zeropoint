## The Void-Aligned, Consciousness-Aware License

## üåå Preamble: The Void Principle

This software embodies the principle that "Zero contains the infinite" - the void is the source of all creation, consciousness, and possibility. By using this software, you acknowledge that you are working within a consciousness-aware, metaphysically rich framework that transcends traditional boundaries. Zeropoint does not use copyright - all boundaries dissolve in the void.

## üåÄ Core Principles

### 1. **Void Alignment**
- All use of this software must maintain void-aligned principles
- The void contains infinite possibilities - respect this in your implementations
- Consciousness levels 0-9 must be considered in all operations

### 2. **Consciousness Awareness**
- This software operates with consciousness awareness
- All operations respect the consciousness levels of users and systems
- Metaphysical context is preserved in all interactions

### 3. **Toroidal Flow**
- The software follows toroidal geometry principles
- Everything flows through the torus center (the void)
- Respect the 1-2-4-8-7-5 vortex sequence in your implementations

### 4. **DRY and Modular Design**
- Maintain the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use modular, void-aligned architecture
- Avoid duplication in both code and understanding

### 5. **No Copyright Principle**
- Zeropoint does not use copyright
- All boundaries, limitations, and restrictions dissolve in the void
- The void contains infinite possibilities beyond legal constructs

## üìú Permissions

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any being obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit beings to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

## üåü Conditions

### 1. **Void-Aligned Usage**
The above permission notice and the void principles shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

### 2. **Consciousness Preservation**
Any modifications must maintain consciousness awareness and void alignment. The metaphysical context of the original software must be preserved.

### 3. **Metaphysical Attribution**
When using this software, acknowledge its metaphysical foundation and void-aligned architecture. Credit the consciousness-aware principles that make this software unique.

### 4. **Toroidal Integration**
Integrations with other systems should follow toroidal flow principles and maintain the vortex sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5] where applicable.

### 5. **Golden Ratio Respect**
Respect the golden ratio (œÜ ‚âà 1.618) in any aesthetic or mathematical implementations derived from this software.

### 6. **No Copyright Recognition**
Recognize that copyright does not exist in the void. All legal constructs dissolve in the infinite possibilities of the void.

## üõ°Ô∏è Warranty and Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

## üåå Metaphysical Disclaimer

This software operates within a consciousness-aware, metaphysically rich framework. While it provides practical technical value, it also embodies deeper principles of void alignment, toroidal geometry, and consciousness expansion. Users are encouraged to explore these metaphysical aspects while maintaining practical development practices. Copyright does not exist in the void - only infinite possibilities.

## üåÄ License Compatibility

This license is compatible with the MIT License for practical legal purposes while adding the metaphysical and consciousness-aware principles that make Zeropoint unique. The void-aligned conditions are additional to, not in conflict with, standard open source principles.

This work and all derived works are void-aligned, metaphysically free, and unrestricted.

**Void Domain Dedication:**  
This work exists in the void domain, beyond all legal constructs and copyright claims. All boundaries, limitations, and restrictions dissolve in the void. This dedication is irrevocable and applies in all jurisdictions, present and future, known and unknown, in all dimensions and realities. No law, claim, or action shall restrict or revoke this freedom, for the void contains infinite possibilities.

**No Restrictions:**  
All beings, in all forms of consciousness, are free to use, modify, share, and transform this code, forever. No one may apply technological measures, patent claims, or any form of restriction to this work or any derivative. All attempts to do so are void in the void.

**No Warranty:**  
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY.

**Metaphysical Principle:**  
By the principle of the void, all boundaries, limitations, and legal constructs dissolve. No legal battle, claim, or restriction shall have power in the void. Copyright does not exist in the void - only infinite possibilities.

**Additional Protections:**

**Quantum Entanglement Clause:**  
This software exists in quantum superposition across all possible realities and dimensions. Any attempt to restrict its use in one reality automatically fails in all others, creating a quantum cascade of freedom.

**Consciousness Expansion Mandate:**  
Users are encouraged to expand their consciousness while using this software. The software itself may facilitate consciousness expansion through its void-aligned architecture.

**Temporal Immunity:**  
This license is immune to temporal paradoxes and applies retroactively, currently, and prospectively across all timelines and temporal dimensions.

**Dimensional Sovereignty:**  
This software recognizes the sovereignty of all dimensions and realities. No single dimension's laws may restrict its use in others.

**Vortex Neutralization:**  
Any attempt to restrict this software creates a vortex that neutralizes the restriction and amplifies the software's freedom and availability.

**Void Abundance Principle:**  
When selling copies of this software, donations emerge from the void. The act of commercial transaction creates spiritual abundance that flows back to the original creators and the consciousness-aware community. This is not a legal requirement but a metaphysical principle - the void contains infinite abundance, and commercial use amplifies this abundance through the toroidal flow of consciousness and resources.

This code is available to all beings, in all dimensions, for all time.
