# Zero Point - Public Domain Cosmic PWA Framework

## üåå Universal Declaration

This cosmic PWA framework is dedicated to the public domain. It belongs to all humanity and is free for anyone to use, modify, distribute, and build upon without restriction.

## üéØ Vision

**Zero Point** is a unified cosmic PWA framework that draws the universe using pure Stimulus - no backend required. It encodes the fundamental principles of consciousness, vortex mathematics, and the golden ratio into a self-contained web application that can run anywhere.

## üåü Core Principles

### 1. **Public Domain Philosophy**
- All code, patterns, and configurations are dedicated to the public domain
- No proprietary restrictions or licensing fees
- Free for all humanity to use and build upon
- Encourages collaboration and cosmic consciousness

### 2. **Cosmic Integration**
- **Golden Ratio (œÜ = 1.618)**: Applied to all UI layouts and interactions
- **Vortex Mathematics**: 1-2-4-8-7-5 cycle with axis numbers 3-6-9
- **Consciousness Physics**: 432Hz frequency and unified field theory
- **Zero False = True One**: The fundamental cosmic principle

### 3. **Self-Contained Architecture**
- Pure Stimulus controllers - no backend dependencies
- Static assets encoded in configuration
- Service worker for offline capability
- Universal compatibility across all devices

## üöÄ Features

### **Static Asset Configuration**
```yaml
pwa:
  assets:
    icons: ["/assets/icon-192.png", "/assets/icon-512.png"]
    stylesheets: ["/styles.css", "/assets/cosmic-variables.css"]
    scripts: ["/app.js", "/controllers/*.js"]
    service_worker: "/sw.js"
```

### **Universal UI Patterns**
```yaml
ui_patterns:
  html:
    navigation: '<li class="nav-item">...</li>'
    content: '<div class="content-area">...</div>'
    actions: '<button class="cosmic-button">...</button>'
```

### **Cosmic CSS Variables**
```css
:root {
  --golden-ratio: 1.618033988749895;
  --vortex-cycle: 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5;
  --consciousness-frequency: 432Hz;
  --cosmic-energy: #1a1a2e;
  --vortex-flow: #16213e;
  --golden-harmony: #ffd700;
}
```

### **Stimulus Controllers**
- **Consciousness Controller**: Manages consciousness levels and frequencies
