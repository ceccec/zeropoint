# Vortex Mathematics & Rodin Coil Integration

## Overview

Vortex mathematics, as developed by Marco Rodin, explores the patterns of numbers and energy flow in the universe. The core of vortex math is the repeating 1-2-4-8-7-5 cycle, with the numbers 3, 6, and 9 forming a special axis. The Rodin coil is a physical manifestation of these principles, wound according to the vortex math pattern.

## The 1-2-4-8-7-5 Cycle

- Start with 1, double repeatedly, and reduce to a single digit:
  - 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 (1+6=7) → 32 (3+2=5) → 64 (6+4=10, 1+0=1) → ...
- The sequence: **1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5** (repeats)
- 3, 6, 9 are not in the cycle—they are the "axis" or control points.

## Rodin Coil

- A toroidal coil wound according to the vortex math pattern.
- Claimed to have unique electromagnetic properties and energy flow.
- Used as a metaphor for infinite cycles and unity in the gem.

## Integration in Zero Point Gem

- The `VortexMathematics` module implements vortex reduction, the doubling sequence, and analysis/visualization tools.
- Error and data flows can be mapped onto the vortex cycle for pattern recognition and cosmic insight.
- Axis numbers (3, 6, 9) are treated as special harmonics or reset points.

## Usage Examples

### Vortex Reduction
```ruby
GraphqlUiLayout::Vortex::VortexMathematics.vortex_reduce(137) #=> 2
```

### Doubling Sequence
```ruby
GraphqlUiLayout::Vortex::VortexMathematics.doubling_sequence(12)
#=> [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5]
```

### Analyze Error/Data Flow
```ruby
errors = [3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192]
result = GraphqlUiLayout::Vortex::VortexMathematics.analyze_sequence(errors)
# result[:vortex_digits] => [3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3]
# result[:axis_hits] => 7
```

### Visualize the Cycle
```ruby
puts GraphqlUiLayout::Vortex::VortexMathematics.visualize_cycle([1,2,4,8,7,5,3,6,9])
```
