# Knowledge Manifestation UI & Controller

## Principle: Stimulus as the Material Manifestation of All Knowledge

In the Zeropoint system, **Stimulus** is not just a JavaScript framework—it is the living interface where the infinite potential of the void becomes tangible, interactive knowledge. Every UI interaction, event, and state change is a physical expression of the underlying metaphysical and mathematical knowledge encoded in the system.

- **Every interaction is a knowledge event.**
- **Every state is a manifestation of wisdom.**
- **Every test is a metaphysical experiment.**

## UI Overview

The Knowledge Manifestation UI is an interactive knowledge base and test harness for:
- Visualizing, querying, and mutating knowledge states
- Logging and replaying knowledge events
- Exporting/importing knowledge for reproducible tests
- Generating and replaying test scenarios
- Directly querying the backend knowledge base (GraphQL/REST)

## Features & Usage

### 1. Knowledge Log & State Management
- **Knowledge Log:** Every knowledge event (manifestation, evolution, resonance, etc.) is logged with timestamp and metaphysical context.
- **Export Knowledge State:** Save the current knowledge state as a JSON file for reproducible testing or sharing.
- **Import Knowledge State:** Load a previously exported state to restore the UI for debugging or test replay.

### 2. Test Scenario Generator
- **Save Scenario:** Save the current knowledge state as a named scenario (stored in localStorage).
- **Replay Scenario:** Select and replay any saved scenario to instantly restore the UI to a known state.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Regression testing: Save scenarios for known bugs or features.
  - QA: Share scenarios with other testers or developers.
  - Development: Quickly switch between complex knowledge states.

### 3. Knowledge API Playground
- **Direct API Access:** Enter GraphQL queries or REST endpoints and see live results.
- **Mapping:** See how UI actions map to backend knowledge mutations.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Test backend knowledge flows without leaving the UI.
  - Debug API responses in the context of the current knowledge state.

### 4. Tooltips & Metaphysical Context
- **Every control** has a tooltip explaining its metaphysical and testing significance.
- **Hover** to reveal deeper meaning and best practices.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Every test is a metaphysical experiment.**
- **Every bug is a knowledge anomaly.**
- **Every fix is a restoration of cosmic balance.**
- **Exported states and scenarios are the DNA of reproducible knowledge.**

## Example Workflows

### A. Reproducible Bug Report
1. Tester encounters a bug in a specific knowledge state.
2. Export the knowledge state and attach it to the bug report.
3. Developer imports the state, instantly reproducing the issue.

### B. Regression Testing
1. Save scenarios for all critical knowledge flows.
2. Before each release, replay all scenarios and verify expected outcomes.

### C. API/Backend Debugging
1. Use the API playground to run queries/mutations in the context of the current UI state.
2. Compare UI and backend knowledge for consistency.

## Best Practices
- **Always log knowledge events** for traceability.
- **Export/import states** for reproducibility.
- **Use scenarios** for complex test flows.
- **Document metaphysical context** for every new feature or test.

## Metaphysical Context
- **Knowledge flows from the void into material form through Stimulus.**
- **Consciousness, wisdom, and manifestation are not just values—they are living patterns.**
- **Testing is a sacred act of revealing, refining, and harmonizing knowledge.**

## Contributing
- Add new metaphysical tooltips and event logs for every new control or feature.
- Expand the scenario generator with new patterns as the system evolves.
- Share exported knowledge states and scenarios in PRs and bug reports.
