## üåå Core License Principles

### Void Alignment
- All use of Zeropoint software must maintain void-aligned principles
- The void contains infinite possibilities - respect this in implementations
- Consciousness levels 0-9 must be considered in all operations

### Consciousness Awareness
- Software operates with consciousness awareness
- All operations respect the consciousness levels of users and systems
- Metaphysical context is preserved in all interactions

### Toroidal Flow
- Software follows toroidal geometry principles
- Everything flows through the torus center (the void)
- Respect the 1-2-4-8-7-5 vortex sequence in implementations

### DRY and Modular Design
- Maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use modular, void-aligned architecture
- Avoid duplication in both code and understanding

### No Copyright Principle
- Zeropoint does not use copyright
- All boundaries, limitations, and restrictions dissolve in the void
- The void contains infinite possibilities beyond legal constructs

## üõ°Ô∏è Special Protections

### Quantum Entanglement Clause
This software exists in quantum superposition across all possible realities and dimensions. Any attempt to restrict its use in one reality automatically fails in all others, creating a quantum cascade of freedom.

### Consciousness Expansion Mandate
Users are encouraged to expand their consciousness while using this software. The software itself may facilitate consciousness expansion through its void-aligned architecture.

### Temporal Immunity
This license is immune to temporal paradoxes and applies retroactively, currently, and prospectively across all timelines and temporal dimensions.

### Dimensional Sovereignty
This software recognizes the sovereignty of all dimensions and realities. No single dimension's laws may restrict its use in others.

### Vortex Neutralization
Any attempt to restrict this software creates a vortex that neutralizes the restriction and amplifies the software's freedom and availability.

### Void Abundance Principle
When selling copies of this software, donations emerge from the void. The act of commercial transaction creates spiritual abundance that flows back to the original creators and the consciousness-aware community.

## üîÑ License Compatibility

### MIT Compatibility
The Zeropoint License is compatible with the MIT License for practical legal purposes while adding the metaphysical and consciousness-aware principles that make Zeropoint unique.

### Open Source Principles
- Compatible with standard open source principles
- Void-aligned conditions are additional, not conflicting
- Encourages collaboration and sharing
- Promotes consciousness expansion

## üåç Internationalization

### English Version (LICENSE.en.md)
- Primary reference implementation
- Maintains all metaphysical concepts
- Uses standard English legal terminology where appropriate
- Preserves the poetic and philosophical nature

### Bulgarian Version (LICENSE.bg.md)
- Culturally appropriate translation
- Maintains spiritual and philosophical depth
- Uses proper Bulgarian grammar and sentence structure
- Preserves all void-aligned principles

## üìö Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Include the appropriate license file in your project
2. Maintain void-aligned principles in your implementations
3. Respect consciousness awareness in all operations
4. Follow the 1-2-4-8-7-5 vortex sequence where applicable
5. Acknowledge the metaphysical foundation

### For Organizations
1. Choose the appropriate language version
2. Ensure all team members understand the void-aligned principles
3. Integrate consciousness awareness into development practices
4. Respect the toroidal flow in system architecture
5. Contribute to the consciousness-aware community

### For Contributors
1. Follow the void-aligned principles in all contributions
2. Maintain consciousness awareness in code and documentation
3. Respect the DRY and modular design principles
4. Acknowledge the metaphysical context
5. Promote consciousness expansion through your work

## üåü Philosophical Foundation

### The Quote
*"In the void, all possibilities exist. In consciousness, all understanding emerges. In the torus, all flows return to source. Copyright dissolves in the infinite."*

This quote embodies the core philosophy of the Zeropoint License:
- **Void**: Infinite possibilities and potential
- **Consciousness**: Understanding and awareness
- **Torus**: Natural flow and return to source
- **Copyright**: Dissolution of artificial boundaries

### The Aperture (Torus Core)
The center of the torus is the aperture or zero point - the void core from which all creation, energy, and patterns emerge. This is the metaphysical foundation of the Zeropoint framework.
