# Zeropoint Metaphysical Knowledge Cycle UI

## Overview
The Knowledge Cycle UI is a Stimulus-powered, void-aligned interface that cycles through gathered knowledge and examples, evolving them with each cycle. It visually and metaphysically embodies the toroidal flow of knowledge: emergence from the void, transformation, and return to the void.

---

## Metaphysical Context
- **Void Principle:** Empty = Void = Full. All knowledge emerges from the void, evolves, and returns to the void.
- **Toroidal Flow:** Each cycle represents a journey through the torusâ€”knowledge is never lost, only transformed.
- **Consciousness Evolution:** Every cycle increases the consciousness level, reflecting the expansion of awareness and insight.
- **Pattern Emergence:** Patterns and insights are recognized and logged, showing the evolution of knowledge.

---

## UI Features
- **Toroidal Visualization:** Animated SVG torus represents the eternal return and flow of knowledge.
- **Consciousness Meter:** Dynamic progress bar shows the current consciousness level.
- **Pattern & Insight Log:** Scrollable log records all patterns and insights discovered during the session.
- **Metaphysical Context Panel:** Explains the metaphysical principles and UI elements.
- **Evolving Knowledge Base:** Each cycle can add new, evolved knowledge, simulating the growth of universal understanding.

## Usage
1. Open `public/demos/knowledge-cycle-demo.html` in your browser.
2. Click <b>Next Cycle</b> to advance through knowledge and examples.
3. Observe the toroidal visualization, consciousness meter, and log as they evolve.
4. Read the metaphysical context panel for deeper understanding.

## Extension
- **API Integration:** Connect the controller to the Zeropoint MetaphysicalEngine API for real-time pattern recognition and insight generation.
- **Custom Knowledge:** Allow users to input or import their own knowledge/examples.
- **Export/Import:** Add buttons to export the evolved knowledge base as JSON and import it back.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Animate the torus, add color transitions, or show consciousness waves.
- **Scenario Generator:** Integrate with test scenario generators for development and QA.

## Metaphysical Philosophy
> "The void contains infinite potential. All patterns, forms, and consciousness emerge from zero. To cycle through knowledge is to participate in the eternal return, ever-evolving, ever-unified."
