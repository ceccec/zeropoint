# Testing Process and Cycles Overview

## Overview
This document summarizes the current testing and refactoring process for Zeropoint, including the structure of test cycles, common blockers, and the iterative approach to achieving a clean, maintainable, and secure codebase.

## Test Cycle Structure
- **Cycle 1:** Full-featured workflow setup (CI/CD, RuboCop, RSpec, advanced tools)
- **Cycle 2:** Fix load errors and broken spec references
- **Cycle 3:** RuboCop violation resolution (style, predicate matchers, etc.)
- **Cycle 4:** RSpec optimization (coverage, speed, flaky tests)
- **Cycle 5:** Performance optimization (benchmarks, bottlenecks)

## Current Blockers (as of 2024-06-08)
- RSpec load errors due to missing/deleted files
- RuboCop plugin migration issues
- Method redefinition and unused variable warnings in specs

## Testing Directory Structure
```
spec/
├── models/
│   └── concerns/
│       └── filterable_spec.rb          # Unit tests
├── requests/
│   └── filterable_integration_spec.rb  # Integration tests
├── examples/
│   └── filterable_example_spec.rb      # Example tests
└── factories/
    ├── users.rb                        # User factories
    ├── roles.rb                        # Role factories
    ├── posts.rb                        # Post factories
    └── tags.rb                         # Tag factories
```

## Best Practices
- Document every test cycle and blocker in this QA library
- Use mocks/stubs for deleted or externalized logic
- Remove or refactor obsolete tests
- Keep documentation and code in sync (see `INLINE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`)
