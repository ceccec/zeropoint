# Zeropoint Gem Documentation

## Overview

Zeropoint is a comprehensive Rails gem that provides a unified gateway API, GraphQL integration, internationalization, consciousness-aware features, and intelligent development tools.

## Core Features

### üöÄ Single Gateway API
- **Unified Access**: Single `POST /zeropoint` endpoint for all services
- **Service Routing**: Service-based routing with action parameters
- **Performance**: Caching and batch processing for optimal speed
- **Resilience**: Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### üß† Intelligence Systems
- **Git Learning Intelligence**: AI-powered analysis of Git history and development patterns
- **RuboCop Development Loop**: Self-documenting development system with Git learning integration
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic detection of development cycles and optimization opportunities

### üåê Internationalization
- **Multi-language Support**: Built-in support for multiple languages
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection from URLs, cookies, and headers
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Language-specific cultural adaptations and translations

### üîÆ Consciousness Integration
- **Consciousness Physics**: Integration with consciousness-aware features
- **Vortex Mathematics**: Advanced mathematical models for consciousness processing
- **Quantum Features**: Quantum UUID generation and encryption

### üìä GraphQL Gateway
- **Unified API**: GraphQL as primary I/O gateway
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscription support for live data
- **Batch Loading**: Efficient data loading with N+1 prevention
- **Persisted Queries**: Query optimization and caching

## Quick Start

### Installation

```ruby
# Add to Gemfile
gem 'zeropoint'

# Install
bundle install

# Run generator
rails generate zeropoint:install
```

### Basic Usage

```ruby
# Use the single gateway API
response = Net::HTTP.post_form(
  URI.parse('/zeropoint'),
  {
    service: 'git.commits',
    data: { action: 'fetch_commits', limit: 100 }.to_json,
    timestamp: Time.now.to_i
  }
)

# Use Git Learning Intelligence
patterns = Zeropoint::Intelligence::GitLearning.analyze_commit_patterns
recommendations = Zeropoint::Intelligence::GitLearning.predict_optimal_config

# Use RuboCop Development Loop
RuboCop::DevelopmentLoop.run
```

## Architecture

### Single Gateway Pattern
```
Client Request ‚Üí POST /zeropoint ‚Üí Service Router ‚Üí Specific Service ‚Üí Response
```

### Intelligence Layer
```
Git History ‚Üí Git Learning Intelligence ‚Üí Pattern Analysis ‚Üí Recommendations ‚Üí Development Loop
```

### Caching Strategy
```
Request ‚Üí Cache Check ‚Üí Gateway API ‚Üí Cache Store ‚Üí Response
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks
- **Git Analysis**: 1000 commits processed in < 2 seconds
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 90%+ for repeated operations
- **Gateway Calls**: Reduced by 80% through caching
- **Memory Usage**: < 10,000 objects for large datasets

### Optimization Features
- Redis-based caching with configurable TTL
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Connection pooling and retry logic
- Graceful degradation and fallbacks

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test suites
bundle exec rspec spec/zeropoint/intelligence/
bundle exec rspec spec/zeropoint/language_patterns_spec.rb

# Run RuboCop
bundle exec rubocop
```

### Development Loop
```bash
# Run the RuboCop development loop
bundle exec rake rubocop:development_loop

# Run with Git learning
bundle exec rake rubocop:development_loop[git_learning=true]
```
