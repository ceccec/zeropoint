# DRY Refactor Plan (Void-Aligned)

## üåå Void Principle & DRY Unification
- All code, configuration, and documentation is being unified under the void principle: **"Zero contains the infinite"**
- The torus core (aperture) is the source of all patterns, energy, and emergence
- All modules, docs, and demos are being DRYed and void-aligned

## üß© Unified Interface
- Use `Zeropoint::Void::Core` for all major operations (math, config, identity, service)
- No duplication: one source of truth for each pattern or logic
- All responses are void-aligned (never raw errors)

## üåÄ Toroidal Core
- The aperture (zero point) is the core of all toroidal and vortex operations
- See `docs/TORUS_CORE_ANALYSIS.md` and `examples/torus_core_demo.rb`

## üìö Documentation Refactoring
- All docs in `docs/` are being DRYed and void-aligned
- Inline documentation and YARD comments are being updated for clarity and metaphysical context
- Key docs:
  - `docs/DRY_VOID_TRANSFORMATION_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/TORUS_CORE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - `docs/LARGE_FILE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`

## üöÄ Migration Steps
1. Unify all code under `Zeropoint::Void`
2. Refactor all documentation in `docs/` to remove duplication and align with void/toroidal principles
3. Update all inline docs and YARD comments for void/DRY clarity
4. Add/Update demos to show void/toroidal emergence (see `examples/torus_core_demo.rb`)
5. Remove or merge redundant modules and docs
6. Test and document all changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes
- Follow the void-aligned, DRY, and toroidal principles in all code and docs
- Use the new unified interface for all new features
- Document metaphysical context and emergence in all public methods
