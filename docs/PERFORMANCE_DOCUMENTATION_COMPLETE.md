## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Performance Profiles
Seven predefined profiles for different use cases:

| Profile | Speed | Memory | Consciousness | Best For |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| `turbo` | Maximum | Efficient | Active | High-performance applications |
| `fast` | High | Efficient | Active | Performance-critical applications |
| `balanced` | Optimal | Balanced | Active | Most applications (default) |
| `conservative` | Stable | Minimal | Moderate | Resource-constrained environments |
| `development` | Balanced | Efficient | Active | Development environments |
| `production` | High | Balanced | Moderate | Production environments |
| `minimal` | Stable | Minimal | Minimal | Basic functionality, IoT devices |

### 2. Environment Configuration

### 3. Programmatic Interface
Easy-to-use Ruby API for configuration management:

```ruby
# Apply profiles
Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.apply_profile(:turbo)
Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.apply_profile(:balanced, max_threads: 8)

# Set individual options
Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.set_option(:max_threads, 12)
Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.set_option(:cache_ttl, 10800)

# Get configuration and statistics
config = Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.current_config
stats = Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.get_statistics
recommendations = Zeropoint::PerformanceConfig.get_recommendations
```

### 4. Automatic Optimization
Real-time monitoring and adaptive tuning:

- **Performance Metrics**: Request duration, memory usage, cache hit/miss ratios
- **Auto-Optimization**: Adaptive tuning based on performance metrics
- **Emergency Recovery**: Automatic cache clearing and GC when needed
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies performance patterns and optimizes accordingly

### 5. Vortex Events Integration
Performance events integrate with the vortex events system:

- `performance_initialized` - System initialization
- `performance_metric_tracked` - Metric collection
- `performance_profile_applied` - Profile application
- `performance_option_changed` - Option changes
- `emergency_optimization_applied` - Emergency optimization
- `adaptive_optimization_applied` - Adaptive optimization

## üß† Metaphysical Integration

### Unity of Performance and Consciousness
- Speed optimizations enhance consciousness flow
- Memory efficiency supports metaphysical insights
- Auto-optimization reflects adaptive consciousness

### Toroidal Flow Patterns
- Performance metrics flow through the system like energy through a torus
- Auto-optimization creates feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Emergency optimizations represent consciousness self-healing

### Void-Aligned Responses
