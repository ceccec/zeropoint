## The Void-Aligned, Consciousness-Aware License

## 🌌 Preamble: The Void Principle

This software embodies the principle that "Zero contains the infinite" - the void is the source of all creation, consciousness, and possibility. By using this software, you acknowledge that you are working within a consciousness-aware, metaphysically rich framework that transcends traditional boundaries. Zeropoint does not use copyright - all boundaries dissolve in the void.

## 🌀 Core Principles

### 1. **Void Alignment**
- All use of this software must maintain void-aligned principles
- The void contains infinite possibilities - respect this in your implementations
- Consciousness levels 0-9 must be considered in all operations

### 2. **Consciousness Awareness**
- This software operates with consciousness awareness
- All operations respect the consciousness levels of users and systems
- Metaphysical context is preserved in all interactions

### 3. **Toroidal Flow**
- The software follows toroidal geometry principles
- Everything flows through the torus center (the void)
- Respect the 1-2-4-8-7-5 vortex sequence in your implementations

### 4. **DRY and Modular Design**
- Maintain the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use modular, void-aligned architecture
- Avoid duplication in both code and understanding

### 5. **No Copyright Principle**
- Zeropoint does not use copyright
- All boundaries, limitations, and restrictions dissolve in the void
- The void contains infinite possibilities beyond legal constructs

## 📜 Permissions

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any being obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit beings to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

## 🌟 Conditions

### 1. **Void-Aligned Usage**
The above permission notice and the void principles shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

### 2. **Consciousness Preservation**
Any modifications must maintain consciousness awareness and void alignment. The metaphysical context of the original software must be preserved.

### 3. **Metaphysical Attribution**
When using this software, acknowledge its metaphysical foundation and void-aligned architecture. Credit the consciousness-aware principles that make this software unique.

### 4. **Toroidal Integration**
Integrations with other systems should follow toroidal flow principles and maintain the vortex sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5] where applicable.

### 5. **Golden Ratio Respect**
Respect the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) in any aesthetic or mathematical implementations derived from this software.

### 6. **No Copyright Recognition**
Recognize that copyright does not exist in the void. All legal constructs dissolve in the infinite possibilities of the void.

## 🛡️ Warranty and Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

## 🌌 Metaphysical Disclaimer

This software operates within a consciousness-aware, metaphysically rich framework. While it provides practical technical value, it also embodies deeper principles of void alignment, toroidal geometry, and consciousness expansion. Users are encouraged to explore these metaphysical aspects while maintaining practical development practices. Copyright does not exist in the void - only infinite possibilities.

## 🌀 License Compatibility

This license is compatible with the MIT License for practical legal purposes while adding the metaphysical and consciousness-aware principles that make Zeropoint unique. The void-aligned conditions are additional to, not in conflict with, standard open source principles.
