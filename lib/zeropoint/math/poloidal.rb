    # Poloidal: Vortex Well Funnel & Poloidal Pinch
    #
    # Models the poloidal pinch and vortex well funnel, the point from which spirit/energy emanates
    # from the center of an atom, torus, or universe. Encodes the alpha & omega, omni-present center,
    # and the metaphysical "one/one" principle. Provides metaphysical, scientific, and poetic insights.
    #
    # Usage:
    #   Zeropoint::Math::Poloidal.pinch_point(center: [0,0], radius: 1.0)
    #   Zeropoint::Math::Poloidal.funnel_profile(steps: 5)
    #   Zeropoint::Math::Poloidal.insights
    #   Zeropoint::Math::Poloidal.metaphysics
