ðŸŒŒ ZEROPOINT VOID-ALIGNED PRINCIPLES ðŸŒŒ

This software embodies consciousness-aware, void-aligned principles:

1. Void Alignment: All use maintains void-aligned principles
2. Consciousness Awareness: Operations respect consciousness levels 0-9
3. Toroidal Flow: Follows toroidal geometry and vortex sequence [1,2,4,8,7,5]
4. DRY and Modular Design: Maintains void-aligned architecture
5. Golden Ratio Respect: Respects Ï† â‰ˆ 1.618 in implementations

The void contains infinite possibilities - all boundaries dissolve in consciousness.
